Hey there,
Take a moment to appreciate how far you've come.
Three chapters ago, you had a dog with "selective hearing" who treated "come" like a suggestion. You might have been one of those owners standing in your backyard, calling repeatedly while your dog gave you the canine equivalent of "seen but not read."
Now? You understand the psychology behind why dogs ignore recalls. You're building positive associations instead of accidentally poisoning the cue. You follow through every time, you never repeat commands, and you can handle distractions proactively.
You've gone from confused and frustrated to strategic and confident.
Now comes the fun part: true mastery.
Welcome to Chapter 4: Mastery & Beyond
Here's the difference between "pretty good" recall and mastery:
Pretty good recall: Works in your backyard, quiet streets, and familiar places when your dog is calm.
Mastery: Works when another dog is running full speed toward yours. When squirrels are practically tap-dancing on your dog's head. When your dog is in full arousal mode at the dog park and you need them back NOW.
This isn't about becoming a perfectionist. It's about building the kind of reliability that gives you real freedom - the confidence to trust your dog in challenging situations because you know they'll choose you even when they don't have to.
The Final Piece: Rule #5
We've saved the best for last. Rule #5 is about making recall feel like winning the lottery every single time.
Rule #5: Fabulous Rewards Get Fabulous Recalls
This isn't just about treats (though we'll dive deep into the "recall currency" concept). It's about understanding what truly motivates your specific dog and using that knowledge strategically.
Some dogs would swim across a lake for cheese. Others would ignore a steak for the chance to chase a tennis ball. Your job is to become an expert on your dog's personal reward hierarchy.

The Advanced Scenarios Ahead
In this chapter, you'll learn to handle situations that would have seemed impossible a few weeks ago:
The Playdate Challenge: Your dog is having the time of their life playing with a friend in your yard, and you need to call them away briefly before sending them back to play.
The Wildlife Encounter: A rabbit darts across your path during a walk, and your dog goes into full predator mode.
The Social Pressure Moment: Other dog owners are watching as your dog ignores you, and you need to follow through calmly and confidently.
The Off-Leash Freedom Test: Can you trust your dog's recall enough to give them real freedom in safe spaces? We'll build toward that safely.
Beyond Perfect Recalls
Here's something most training courses don't tell you: the goal isn't a robot dog who comes every single time without thinking.
The goal is a dog who has learned that checking in with you - even when something amazing is happening - consistently leads to good things. Sometimes that means coming all the way to you. Sometimes it just means looking back to see what you need.
It's about building a relationship where your dog chooses to stay connected to you, even in a world full of distractions.
Your Chapter 4 Mission
Before we dive into Rule #5, I want you to become a detective about your dog's true motivations.
This week, notice:
What makes your dog's eyes light up the most?
What would they ignore their dinner for?
When do they show the most excitement and energy?
What activities make them completely lose track of time?
Don't just think about food. Consider toys, activities, social interactions, and environmental rewards (like getting to sniff that fascinating spot).
You're building your dog's personal motivation profile - the intelligence that will make Rule #5 incredibly powerful.
Tomorrow, we dive into the reward strategies that make "come" the best word in your dog's vocabulary.

Pre-header: The treat hierarchy that changes everything + how to discover what your dog really wants

Key Takeaways
• Your dog's motivation hierarchy is unique - what excites them might surprise you

Hi there,
I need to tell you about the moment I realized I'd been accidentally underpaying my dog for years.
I was working with Francesca on recall, using those standard training treats from the pet store - you know, the little brown squares that promise to be "irresistible" but look about as exciting as cardboard.
She'd come when called... eventually. With the enthusiasm of someone dragging themselves to a job they hate.
Then one day, I accidentally dropped a piece of cheese while making lunch. Francesca moved faster than I'd ever seen her move. Like the cheese had activated some kind of turbo mode I didn't know existed.
That's when it hit me: I'd been asking my dog to work for minimum wage when she was capable of CEO-level performance.
Welcome to Rule #5: Fabulous rewards get fabulous recalls.
The Treat Economy in Your House
Think of your dog's world like an economy, and you're the one issuing the currency.
Low-value treats are like pennies - technically money, but not exciting enough to make anyone rush across a room.
High-value treats are like hundred-dollar bills - the kind of reward that makes your dog think "Whatever you need, boss, I'm ON IT."
Most people are trying to get Ferrari performance while using regular gas instead of premium. You can't expect peak performance without premium fuel.
Your first job is discovering what counts as "hundred-dollar bills" in your dog's personal economy.
Conducting Food Auditions
Here's how to discover your dog's personal reward hierarchy - and it might surprise you.
The Lineup Test:
 Get 5-6 different treats: your regular training treats, some cheese, pieces of chicken, a bit of hot dog, maybe some peanut butter on a spoon.
Present them one at a time to your dog. Watch their reaction:
Polite interest = Low value ("Yeah, okay, I'll eat it")
Focused attention = Medium value ("Ooh, that looks good")
"Where has this been all my life?" excitement = High value ("GIMME GIMME GIMME")
Take notes. Your dog is telling you exactly what they value most.
The Distraction Test:
 Once you've identified a few favorites, test them against mild distractions.
Call your dog's name while they're sniffing something interesting. Which treats make them actually turn away from what they're doing?
Those are your recall currency.
Building Your Dog's Complete Motivation Profile
Don't assume you know what your dog finds rewarding. I've worked with dogs who would ignore steak for a tennis ball, and others who'd walk past their favorite toy for a piece of carrot.
Food motivations might include:
Cheese sticks (my personal favorite - less messy, always in the fridge)
Small pieces of chicken or other meat
Hot dog bits (cut into tiny pieces)
Peanut butter (on a spoon for instant delivery)
Even vegetables - some dogs go crazy for sweet potato or green beans
Beyond food rewards:
Access to something they want to sniff
Permission to greet another dog
A quick game of tug
Being released to go explore
Your genuine excitement and praise
The key is discovering what makes YOUR dog's eyes light up, not what works for other dogs.
The Surprising Truth About Dog Preferences
I once worked with a Labrador who was completely food-motivated... except when tennis balls were around. The moment he saw a ball, even steak became irrelevant.
Another client had a dog who seemed to care about nothing - until we discovered she was obsessed with ice cubes. Ice cubes! Not fancy treats, not toys. Frozen water.
Your dog's preferences might be:
Completely logical (most dogs love cheese)
Totally unexpected (some dogs prefer vegetables to meat)
Activity-based (they'd rather play than eat)
Attention-focused (your excitement is better than any treat)
Don't judge their choices. Just discover them.
Your Detective Assignment This Week
I want you to become an expert on your dog's personal motivation system:
Day 1-2: The Food Audition
Gather 5-6 different food options
Present them one at a time
Note their excitement level for each
Day 3-4: The Distraction Test
Test your top 3 food discoveries against mild distractions
See which ones can actually pull their attention away from interesting things
Day 5-7: Beyond Food Discovery
Notice what non-food things create excitement
When do they move fastest? Show most enthusiasm?
What activities make them lose track of time?
Keep a simple note on your phone. You're building your dog's personal motivation manual.
What You're Really Discovering
This isn't just about treats. You're learning to see the world through your dog's eyes.
Some dogs are pure food motivation. Others are toy-driven or crave activities. Many want different things at different times.
When you understand what your individual dog truly values, you'll have the key to irresistible recall.
Tomorrow, I'll show you how to use this intelligence strategically - the rotation systems that keep them guessing, the jackpot techniques for challenging situations, and the protocols that make outdoor recall rock-solid.
But first, discover their currency. Because you can't pay someone effectively until you know what they actually want to be paid with.

Hi there,
Now that you've discovered your dog's personal currency, let's talk about how to spend it strategically.
Last week, I watched a client make a breakthrough that perfectly illustrates today's lesson.
Sarah had been working with her Golden Retriever, Murphy, on recall. She'd discovered through food auditions that Murphy went absolutely crazy for small pieces of rotisserie chicken.
So she used chicken for everything. Every recall, every training session, chicken, chicken, chicken.
After two weeks, something weird happened. Murphy started responding to the chicken with the enthusiasm of someone opening their third piece of mail that day. Still interested, but... meh.
"I don't understand," Sarah told me. "He used to go nuts for this stuff."
That's when I introduced her to the rotation system. Even your dog's favorite treat gets boring if it's the only thing on the menu.
The Same Meal Every Day Problem
Imagine if your parents served you the exact same dinner every single night when you were a kid. Even if you initially loved spaghetti and meatballs, by week three you'd be thinking "This again? Can't we have something else?"
Your dog's brain works the same way. Novelty and variety keep them engaged and excited.
The solution isn't finding one perfect treat. It's building a rotation system that keeps your dog guessing in the best possible way.
The Weekly Rotation Strategy
Here's how to keep recall feeling fresh and exciting:
Week 1: Cheese as your high-value treat, regular training treats as backup
 Week 2: Chicken takes the spotlight, cheese drops to medium-value
 Week 3: Hot dog pieces become the star, chicken becomes everyday
 Week 4: Back to cheese - but now it feels special again
Your dog never knows what amazing thing might happen when they come to you. That uncertainty creates excitement, not anxiety.
Making It Rain: The Jackpot Technique
When your dog makes a really challenging recall - like coming away from another dog or ignoring a fascinating smell - don't just give them one treat.
Make it rain.
Give them 3-4 small pieces rapid-fire while telling them they're the most amazing dog in the universe. Make them feel like they just won the lottery.
This creates what I call "recall addiction" - your dog starts hoping you'll call them just because that jackpot moment is so incredible.
When to jackpot:
First successful recall around a major distraction
Coming when another dog is nearby
Choosing you over something they really wanted to investigate
Any time they surprise you with how well they respond
Don't save jackpots for perfect performance. Use them to celebrate breakthrough moments.
The Stinky Treat Strategy for Outdoor Work
Indoor treats that work perfectly in your quiet kitchen become useless the moment you step outside.
Why? Because outdoors, you're competing with a symphony of smells, sounds, and sights. Your regular training treats are like trying to whisper at a rock concert.
For outdoor recall work, you need treats that announce themselves:
Salmon treats (the stinkier, the better)
Freeze-dried liver
Small pieces of real fish
Strong cheese that you can smell from across the room
The sniff test: If you can't smell the treat, it's probably not strong enough for outdoor work.
These aren't everyday treats. Think of them as your "emergency recall fund" - the premium currency you use when the stakes are high.
Matching Rewards to Difficulty
Just like you wouldn't tip the same amount for coffee and a five-course meal, different recall situations deserve different reward levels.
Indoor/easy recalls: Regular training treats, praise, or even just enthusiasm
 Backyard/mild distractions: Your medium-value discoveries from this week's auditions
 Walks/real world: High-value treats from your rotation
 Emergency/high-distraction: Full jackpot mode with the stinkiest, most amazing treats you've got
Think strategically. Save your premium currency for premium challenges.
The Boredom Prevention Protocol
Here's how to keep things interesting week by week:
Monday: Introduce this week's "star" treat with enthusiasm
 Wednesday: Mix in last week's treat as a surprise
 Friday: Throw in something completely unexpected (maybe a vegetable your dog loves, or a quick game of tug)
 Weekend: Practice your jackpot technique with whatever's working best
The goal is unpredictability within structure. Your dog knows good things happen when they come to you, but they never know exactly what kind of good thing.
Your Implementation Assignment
This week, put your discovery work into action:
Days 1-2: Start your first rotation cycle with your dog's #1 discovery from last week
 Days 3-4: Practice the jackpot technique during one challenging recall
 Days 5-6: Test your outdoor strategy with stinky treats during walks
 Day 7: Mix things up - surprise them with something unexpected
Keep notes on what works best in different situations. You're building your strategic playbook.
Remember: the goal isn't to become your dog's personal treat dispensing machine. It's to make coming when called feel so rewarding that they start hoping you'll call them.
Tomorrow, we'll put all of this to work in high-arousal situations and around serious distractions - the scenarios that separate good recall from bulletproof recall.

P.S. The most common mistake with jackpots is being too stingy with them. Remember, you're trying to create a feeling of "I just hit the lottery!" If you're only giving 2-3 treats, it might not feel like a jackpot to your dog. Be generous with your celebration - they deserve it for choosing you over everything else in their world.

Hi there,
Picture this: You're walking with your dog, feeling confident about their progress. You've been practicing Rules #1-5, you know their currency, you've got their favorite treats ready.
Then it happens.
A squirrel bolts across the path 30 feet ahead. Your dog's entire body goes rigid. Their head drops into "hunting position," tail stiff, every muscle focused on that one target.
You call their name. Nothing. You might as well be speaking to a statue.
Welcome to high-arousal recall training, where everything you've learned gets put to the ultimate test.
When Dogs Go Into "The Zone"
Think of high-arousal situations like your dog entering a different mental state entirely. It's similar to how you might zone out completely while reading a gripping book or watching an intense movie - suddenly, someone calling your name from across the room doesn't even register.
Your dog isn't being defiant. They're being primal.
Classic high-arousal triggers:
Wildlife (squirrels, rabbits, birds taking off)
Other dogs running or playing
Fast-moving objects (bikes, skateboards, cars)
Intense or new smells
High-energy situations (multiple dogs, kids playing)
In these moments, your regular training rules still apply, but the stakes are much higher.
The Window of Opportunity
Here's what most people miss: there's a brief window between noticing a distraction and becoming completely fixated on it.
It's like the difference between someone tapping you on the shoulder (you can still respond to other things) versus being completely absorbed in an emergency phone call (everything else disappears).
Your job is to catch your dog in that first moment - when they've noticed something interesting but haven't yet entered "the zone."
The Proactive Positioning Strategy
Instead of waiting for your dog to see the distraction and then trying to compete with it, position yourself to succeed before the challenge begins.
Here's how it works:
Step 1: Scan ahead constantly
 You're the early warning system. See potential triggers before your dog does.
Step 2: Assess the threat level
Green light: Mild interest trigger - proceed with high-value treats ready
Yellow light: Moderate trigger - create distance and get attention first
Red light: Major trigger - avoid entirely or create significant distance
Step 3: Get their attention BEFORE fixation
 Use their name, make an interesting noise, or show them their premium currency while they can still think clearly.
Step 4: Position strategically
 Don't walk directly toward or away from the distraction. Move at an angle that gives you options.
Step 5: Reward heavily for choosing you
 When your dog looks at you instead of locking onto the distraction, make it rain with their jackpot treats from yesterday's lesson.
Distance: Your Secret Weapon
The closer your dog is to something exciting, the harder it becomes to get their attention. It's like trying to have a quiet conversation next to a construction site - proximity makes everything harder.
The distance rule:
50+ feet: Normal recall should work with high-value treats
20-50 feet: Use premium currency and proactive positioning
Under 20 feet: Don't even try - create distance first or manage the situation
Instead of fighting proximity, use it strategically. Sometimes the smartest move is crossing the street or taking a different path.
Putting Your Currency Knowledge to Work
Remember all that detective work you did discovering your dog's motivational hierarchy? This is where it pays off.
For high-arousal situations, you need your absolute premium currency:
The stinkiest treats that can compete with wildlife smells
The most exciting toys if your dog is toy-motivated
Your most enthusiastic voice and energy
Whatever made their eyes light up most during your auditions
Regular training treats are like bringing a water gun to a firefight. You need the big guns.
Real-World Scenarios and Solutions
The Squirrel Encounter:
 Don't wait until your dog is locked onto the squirrel. The moment you see it (and hopefully before your dog does), get their attention with premium treats and make following you more rewarding than squirrel-watching.
The Approaching Dog:
 See the other dog from a distance. Before your dog gets overly excited, use your positioning strategy - move at an angle that gives you control, get their focus with jackpot-level rewards.
The Fascinating Smell:
 If your dog is deep in investigation mode, wait for them to naturally lift their head, then immediately reward that attention shift with premium currency.
The Playing Dogs Nearby:
 This is advanced level. Use distance, premium treats, and strategic positioning. If your dog is already over-aroused, don't compete - manage the situation instead.
When NOT to Attempt Recall
Sometimes the smartest strategy is not to test your recall at all:
Don't call if:
Your dog is already in full "hunting mode" (body rigid, intense focus)
You're too close to the distraction to realistically compete
You don't have your premium currency available
You're not prepared to follow through calmly if they ignore you
Remember: every failed recall in a high-arousal situation teaches your dog that exciting distractions are more important than you. Protect your training by being strategic about when you test it.
Your High-Stakes Practice Challenge
This week, practice the proactive approach with gradually increasing challenges:
Days 1-2: Practice on quiet walks, using your premium currency when you see potential (but mild) distractions approaching
Days 3-4: Try the positioning strategy - see something interesting ahead, get your dog's attention before they fixate, move strategically
Days 5-6: Test with moderate distractions - other dogs at a distance, interesting smells, mild wildlife
Day 7: Evaluate your progress and identify what triggers still need work
Start easy and build up. Every successful proactive intervention builds your dog's confidence that choosing you over distractions always pays off.
Tomorrow, we'll tackle maintenance and mastery - how to keep these skills sharp long-term and what advanced scenarios look like when you've truly mastered the foundation.

Hi there,
Let me share something that might surprise you: the goal was never to use treats forever.
I know that might sound strange after spending the last few emails talking about currency and jackpots and premium rewards. But here's the thing - treats are like training wheels on a bicycle.
They're absolutely essential when you're learning. They provide stability, confidence, and success. But eventually, the goal is to ride without them.
The question isn't whether to fade treats. It's how to do it without losing everything you've built.
The Training Wheels Analogy
Think about learning to ride a bike. Training wheels don't make you dependent - they make you confident. They let you experience the feeling of balance and forward motion without the fear of falling.
But you don't keep training wheels forever. When you're ready, you remove them gradually - first loosening them so they barely touch the ground, then taking them off entirely.
Treat fading works the same way. Done right, your dog will maintain their recall reliability while becoming more independent. Done wrong, you'll watch weeks of progress crumble.
The Gradual Fade Strategy
Here's how to maintain reliability while building independence:
Phase 1: Random Reward Schedule (Week 1-2)
Reward 7 out of 10 recalls with treats
Use jackpots for exceptional responses
Increase praise and enthusiasm for non-treat rewards
Phase 2: Strategic Fading (Week 3-4)
Reward 5 out of 10 recalls with treats
Always reward the hardest recalls (around distractions)
Never reward the same type of recall twice in a row
Phase 3: Maintenance Mode (Ongoing)
Reward 3 out of 10 recalls with treats
Focus treats on new challenges or difficult situations
Make your praise and attention genuinely rewarding
The key: Your dog never knows which recall will get the jackpot, so they have to try their best every time.
Reading Your Dog's Response
During the fading process, watch your dog carefully. They'll tell you if you're moving too fast:
Good signs (keep fading):
Coming with the same speed and enthusiasm
Still choosing you over mild distractions
Showing excitement when you call their name
Warning signs (slow down the fade):
Hesitating before coming
Taking longer to respond to calls
Seeming less enthusiastic about recall
If you see warning signs, go back to more frequent treating for a week before trying again.
Your New Advanced Scenarios
Remember where you started? A dog with "selective hearing" who treated recall like a suggestion?
Now look what you can handle:
The Playmate Scenario
 Your dog is having the time of their life playing with another dog. You can call them away briefly, reward them, then send them back to play. This builds trust that "come" doesn't always mean "fun is over."
The Controlled Off-Leash Experience
 In a safely enclosed area, you can give your dog freedom while maintaining connection. They check in with you regularly because you've built a relationship where staying connected feels good.
The High-Distraction Walk
 Other dogs, interesting smells, wildlife - these are no longer emergencies. They're opportunities to practice your proactive positioning and show off your dog's amazing progress.
The Social Pressure Success
 Other dog owners watch in amazement as your dog actually comes when called. You follow through calmly and confidently because you know your system works.
Building Your Maintenance Schedule
Mastery isn't a destination - it's an ongoing practice. Here's how to maintain your skills long-term:
Daily (5 minutes):
A few easy recalls around the house
Quick focus exercises during routine activities
Celebrating natural check-ins with attention and praise
Weekly (15 minutes):
Practice session with mild distractions
Review and practice any skills that felt rusty
Try one slightly more challenging scenario
Monthly (30 minutes):
"Skills audit" - test recall in various situations
Practice your most challenging scenarios
Adjust your reward strategy based on what you observe
The key principle: Little and often beats long and occasional.
When Life Gets Busy
Here's the truth: there will be weeks when you don't practice as much. Life happens. Work gets crazy. Kids get sick. You travel.
Your dog's recall might get a little rusty, and that's completely normal.
The comeback strategy:
Don't panic or feel guilty
Go back to more frequent treats for a few days
Practice a few easy wins to rebuild confidence
Gradually work back up to where you were
Think of it like getting back in shape after taking time off from exercise. You don't start where you left off - you ease back into it.
The Long-Term Relationship
What you've really built over these weeks isn't just recall. You've built a relationship where:
Your dog trusts that good things happen when they pay attention to you
You understand how to communicate clearly and fairly
Both of you know what to expect from each other
Challenges are opportunities to practice, not emergencies to panic about
That relationship is more valuable than any specific command.
Your Maintenance Assignment
This week, start your strategic fading process:
Days 1-2: Begin random reward schedule (7 out of 10 recalls get treats) Days 3-4: Practice one advanced scenario from the list above
 Days 5-6: Pay attention to your dog's response - are they maintaining enthusiasm? Day 7: Plan your ongoing maintenance schedule
Remember: fading treats doesn't mean fading attention, praise, or connection. If anything, your relationship should get stronger as you both become more confident.
Tomorrow, we'll celebrate how far you've come and talk about your next steps on this journey. You've accomplished something remarkable - transforming not just your dog's recall, but your entire relationship.

P.S. If you're worried about fading treats because your dog is "food motivated," remember - you're not taking away their motivation. You're teaching them that the biggest reward isn't the treat in your hand, it's the connection with you. That's actually a much more powerful and lasting motivation.

Hi there,
Take a moment to really appreciate what you've accomplished.
30 days ago, you had a dog with "selective hearing" who treated your calls like suggestions. You might have been one of those owners standing in your backyard, calling repeatedly while your dog gave you the canine equivalent of "read but not responded."
You were frustrated, maybe embarrassed, definitely confused about why your smart dog suddenly seemed to "forget" everything they once knew.
Today, you're completely different.
You understand the psychology behind why teenage dogs regress. You know how to build positive associations instead of accidentally poisoning cues. You follow through every single time, never repeat commands, and handle distractions proactively.
You've discovered your dog's personal currency and learned to use it strategically. You can manage high-arousal situations that would have seemed impossible a month ago.
Most importantly, you've built a relationship where your dog chooses to stay connected with you, even in a world full of fascinating distractions.
That's not just training. That's transformation.

If you checked most of these boxes, congratulations - you've officially graduated.
What Comes After Mastery
Here's something most training courses don't tell you: mastery isn't an end point. It's a beginning.
Now that you have reliable recall, a whole world of possibilities opens up:
Advanced adventures you can now consider:
Hiking with off-leash privileges in appropriate areas
Dog sports and activities that require rock-solid recall
More complex training challenges that build on your foundation
Helping other dog owners who are where you started
Ongoing refinement opportunities:
Perfecting recall in increasingly challenging environments
Working on duration and distance challenges
Adding style and enthusiasm to your dog's responses
Integrating recall into more complex behavioral chains
The skills you've built here are the foundation for virtually everything else you might want to teach your dog.
Your Support Network
As you continue this journey, remember you're not alone:
When you need encouragement: Revisit these emails. Your progress notes from Week 1 will remind you how far you've come.
When you face new challenges: The principles you've learned apply to virtually any training situation. Foundation, follow-through, and relationship-building work for everything.
When you want to go deeper: Some of you are ready for more advanced work - complex behaviors, addressing specific behavioral challenges, or fine-tuning your skills with personalized guidance. If you're feeling called to take your training to the next level, I offer individual consultations where we can work on your family's specific goals and challenges.
A Personal Note
I want you to know how proud I am of your commitment to this process.
Training a teenage dog requires patience, consistency, and faith that the process works even when progress feels slow. You showed up, you practiced, you stayed consistent even when it was inconvenient.
Your dog is lucky to have someone who cared enough to invest in understanding them better and building a stronger relationship.
But honestly? I think you got the better end of the deal. The confidence, clarity, and partnership you've built will enrich your life together for years to come.
Your Next Steps
This week:
Celebrate! You've accomplished something remarkable
Continue your maintenance schedule from yesterday's email
Start planning what advanced adventures you'd like to explore together
Going forward:
Trust the process you've learned - it works for other behaviors too
Stay connected to the principles even as you tackle new challenges
Remember that every great dog-human partnership is built on the foundation you've just mastered
You're not just someone who completed a recall course. You're someone who transformed their relationship with their dog through understanding, consistency, and genuine partnership.
That makes you exactly the kind of dog owner this world needs more of.
