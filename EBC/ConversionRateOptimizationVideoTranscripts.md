Transcript:
(00:00) the Ada model is no longer the best layout for your landing pages we have reinvented the model and it converts much much better steal this model today implement it and watch your conversion rates sore let's jump into it okay guys so before we start running through the model My Name is Oliver Kenyan I am co-founder of conversion wise and my company conversion wise has designed more custom landing pages than any Agency on this planet we have been doing this for over a decade and we are obsessed with what it takes to turn a
(00:35) click into a customer now let's look at the old Ada framework or model Ada stands for attention interest desire and action and it's a brilliant way to lay out your landing pages in order to convert a click into a customer but there's a better way we have developed a new framework and I'm going to share it with you in this video I want to in introduce you to the a ID COA model and after designing 7,000 plus landing pages it's a framework that we've developed that actually converts better than Ada this one stands for
(01:15) attention transformation interest desire compare objections and action and as I said it's a framework that if you follow it to the T it's going to convert far far better than the a frame workor itself so let's jump straight into each individual section okay so we start with a which is attention and this is the most important section of your landing page it's the above the fold section basically the bit that loads as soon as you go on a website whether that's tablet mobile or desktop you have roughly 3 to 5 Seconds to get your cold
(01:54) consumer sucked into what you're doing before they actually bounce and leave your page so how do we do this in this attention section we start with a strong value proposition we back it up with trust and credibility we want to show some social proof we want some images that grab our attention and we want a strong call to action now if we do all these things correctly and tick all these boxes people are more likely to then scroll through to our next section that next section is T for transformation and this is a new section
(02:27) we've introduced into the AA model so in the transformation section what we want to do is take someone on a visual transformation we want them to visualize buying the product receiving the product and then benefiting from the product and typically we do that with a couple of things we use text we use images or icons and most importantly we actually annotate the steps so we say step one step two step three step one is typically how you buy the product whether that's physical or digital step two two is how you actually receive that
(03:01) product whether it's a download or it's actually sent to you in the post and step three most importantly is not receiving the product but it's actually the outcome the benefit the end goal for the consumer now once we've taken them through that transformation the next section on your landing page is the I for interest section and we can split this into two equal sections section one is benefits now this is where we tell them all of the benefits they're going to get from utilizing our product again it doesn't matter if this is a digital
(03:34) product a physical product if it's a service a solution a software outlay the benefits that your consumers are actually going to achieve from actually buying into your product stay clear of any shiny object stay clear of any features and just tell the consumer exactly what they're going to get as an end result once we've told them exactly how they benefit we can move forward with that second section in the interest section which is features and this is actually where you outline how you actually fulfill the benefits that
(04:09) they're going to get this is where you can go into detail around the actual technical aspect of delivering the benefit to the consumer you can break down your product features you can break down what actually goes into delivering your product if it's a digital product talk about how many courses you deliver how many ebooks you give them how much access they get do they get access to a community but you only do this when first and foremost in this interest section you've outlaid exactly what they're going to get as a benefit of the
(04:41) product itself don't forget the old cliche guys features tell benefit cell and that's why we always lead with the benefit moving down to the d section and d stands for desire and this is all about fomo you've told them how you're going to deliver the benefits via the features and now we need to make them desire it using other people's opinions and reviews so this is where you can include reviews testimonials case studies user generated content but everything here has to be a positive talking about your product and therefore
(05:18) I see other people who have used your product and benefited from it and therefore I as a consumer now want to buy into your product myself so now that this person desires your product through social proof we can take them onto section c and that stands for compare and this is another new section that we've injected over the last 10 years into the Ada model or framework in this section you have two options you can compare your product against your competitors or you can compare your product against a generalization within your Market an
(05:54) example of point two is positioning your product against a broader Market trend or general consumer needs and expectations here you can use things like comparison tables to visibly compare your Superior product or generalization against the other competitor's product or an generalization within your market for example you may not want to compare your protein powder against a competitor's protein powder but you might want to argue the fact that protein powder is far better better for you than eating protein bars that's a generalization of
(06:35) comparison moving on to O and that stands for objections and this is another new section that we've injected into this framework that we've found turn your clicks into customers so much more than the old model inside the objection section we basically want to handle any consumer questions or objections they may have in their head the best way to do this is is using a simple FAQ answer any objections surrounding the ordering the returns the outcomes the benefits or any technical questions about your product so that you don't
(07:12) leave that cold consumer with questions in their head they have to leave your page to go and find out any questions that they have in their head should be answered within this simple FAQ and last but not least we take them down to a which stands for action if we are lucky enough that they have scrolled all the way to the bottom of our landing pages then quite simply we need to give them the clearest call to action possible don't give them an excuse to look for that call to action shove it right in front of their face don't make them
(07:51) scroll back up don't make them look for the button put it in front of them add to cart now buy mine now get instant access now make them take action now this is by far the best way to lay out your landing pages and if you want more tips and tricks on skyrocketing your conversion rates then make sure you check out our YouTube channel or if you want my agency who have built more landing pages than any other Agency on this planet to design you a high converting page or store then get in touch at conversion wise.com I'll see

(01:01) image it's really nice to give someone a clear value perception of what they get when they join your course or membership this is backed up with social proof you can see the previous page had zero social proof a big no no utilized social proof mentioned how much ratings you've got and how many people rated you then we have this nice far more benefit outcome driven short and value proposition in the headline supported by that subtext we have a really clear call to to action above the fold it tells us exactly what we're going to do on that
(01:34) next step versus the before design where the button quite frankly just looked like a headline in a white box a big no no it didn't even look like a button I guarantee if these guys had heat map software it would say that this would get very few clicks below that button we've got this nice oneliner that introduces some form of kind of fomo and and really incentivizes someone to join up now because we we say that there's limited spots and then at the bottom of the page instead of having this really long paragraph of text that doesn't get read
(02:06) and is quite frankly boring we've extracted the key facts we've extracted those stats that's going to help sell this course we've anchored the CTA with them and we're going to demand more people therefore sign up let me know what you think of this transformation in the comments below hit the thumbs up subscribe to the channel I'll see you in the very next one

(00:35) single element has been added to encourage people to turn from a click to a customer and to generate the brand more Revenue per session let's start with item number one we've added our trust policy bar this is a small bar where you add icons and text that make you trusted as a brand imagine these are cold consumers they don't know you they're just landing on your page from a cold ad or an email or whever that attribution Channel may be so let's use statements that make us real credible and trusted as a company let's use
