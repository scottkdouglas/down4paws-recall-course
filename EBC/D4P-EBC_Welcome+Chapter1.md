Subject Line: [Start] Welcome to the most reliable recall course ever! Click the link in this email to get started.

Hey there,
Welcome to the 30-Day Teenage Dog Transformation!
I'm Pam, and I've been helping frustrated dog owners like you for years. Here's what I know for sure: your dog isn't broken, stubborn, or "just being difficult."
What you're dealing with is completely normal (and completely fixable).
Over the next 30 days, you're going to learn exactly why your smart dog suddenly stopped listening, and more importantly, how to get them coming reliably again - even when there are squirrels, other dogs, or whatever else has been stealing their attention.
Before We Start
I want to make sure you actually receive these emails! Sometimes they can end up in your promotions or spam folder.
Please add my email address to your contacts and check that folder if you don't see tomorrow's email.
This course works best when you get each lesson on schedule, so this step is important.
Here's How This Works
You'll get an email every 1-2 days with specific steps to practice. Each email builds on the last one, so don't skip ahead - trust the process.
Some days will feel like breakthroughs. Other days might feel challenging. That's completely normal and part of building reliable recall.
Your only job is to show up consistently and follow the steps.

Welcome to Chapter 1!
You clicked the link, which means you're officially committed to transforming your dog's recall over the next 30 days. That's already more than most frustrated dog owners do - they just keep repeating the same things and hoping for different results.
Here's what we're going to accomplish in this first chapter:
What You'll Learn in Chapter 1
Email 1.1: The Truth About Teenage Dogs
 I'll explain exactly what's happening in your dog's brain between 6 months and 3 years old, and why this phase exists. You'll finally understand that your dog isn't being "stubborn" on purpose.
Email 1.2: Why Smart Dogs "Forget" Their Training
 We'll dive into the 3 biggest mistakes owners make during this phase (you're probably doing at least 2 of them), plus I'll give you a simple 48-hour "reset" strategy that breaks the frustration cycle.
Email 1.3: The Psychology of "Paying Your Dog to Work"
 You'll discover how dogs actually learn vs. how we think they learn, and I'll show you the treat station strategy that makes your dog WANT to work for you.
Why This Chapter Matters
Right now, you're probably feeling like you're in a battle of wills with your dog. But here's the thing: you're not in a battle at all.
Your dog's brain is literally rewiring itself, and if you understand what's happening, you can work WITH this process instead of against it.
By the end of Chapter 1, you'll stop taking your dog's behavior personally and start seeing it as information. That shift changes everything.
Your Chapter 1 Mission
For the next few days, I want you to become a detective. Observe your dog's behavior patterns for the next 24 hours.
Notice:
When do they ignore you most?
What seems to distract them easily?
Are there times they naturally come to you?
What's their energy like at different times of day?
Don't try to fix anything yet - just observe. We're gathering intelligence.
The first real lesson arrives tomorrow, and it's going to explain why your smart, well-trained dog suddenly started acting like they've never heard the word "come" before.

Hey there,
Let me paint you a picture from my training sessions:
A family calls me, completely frustrated. "Our dog used to be perfect," they tell me. "At four months old, he came every time we called. Now at 14 months, it's like he's wearing invisible headphones."
I walk into their house, and there's this gorgeous Golden Retriever - smart eyes, clearly well-loved, obviously not "broken." But when his owner calls him from across the room, he glances over with what I can only describe as a teenager's eye-roll and goes back to sniffing the couch.
Sound familiar?
Here's what I told that family (and what I'm telling you): Your dog isn't broken.
What's Really Happening in Your Dog's Brain
Between 6 months and 3 years old, your dog's brain is going through the same rewiring process as a human teenager. It's like their mental operating system is getting a major software update - and just like your phone during an update, some things stop working reliably for a while.
During this phase, they're not thinking "How can I annoy my human today?" They're thinking "Wait, do I really have to do everything you say? What happens if I test this boundary? What's the worst that could happen?"
It's not rebellion - it's brain development.
Think of it like this: imagine you're learning to drive. At first, every instruction from your driving instructor gets followed immediately because you're focused and nervous. But after a few months, when they say "Check your mirrors," part of your brain thinks "Yeah, yeah, I know" even though you still need the reminder.
Your dog's brain is doing something similar. They know the commands, but their confidence is growing and they're starting to question whether they really have to listen.
The Heartbreaking Truth About This Phase
Here's what breaks my heart: this is exactly when most dogs end up in shelters.
We call it the "compulsive rehoming stage" in dog training because frustrated families think their dog has suddenly become "bad" or "stubborn." But this is actually when your dog needs you most - they're not pushing you away, they're testing whether you'll stick around when things get challenging.
It's like a teenager acting out to see if their parents will still love them when they're not perfect.
Your First Assignment
I want you to get honest about where you're starting. Rate your dog's current recall on a scale of 1-10:
1 = "What's a 'come' command?"
5 = "Sometimes, if there's nothing interesting happening"
10 = "Drops everything and comes running every time"
Write that number down somewhere. We're checking back in 30 days, and I promise you'll be amazed at the difference.
More importantly, I want you to start seeing your dog's "disobedience" differently. Every time they ignore you, they're not being defiant - they're asking a question: "Is this rule still in effect? Are you still in charge? Can I trust you to be consistent?"
Tomorrow, I'll show you the 3 biggest mistakes that accidentally answer those questions the wrong way.

Subject Line: [1.2] The 3 mistakes that make teenage dog behavior worse
Pre-header: Why smart dogs suddenly act "stubborn" + the reset that changes everything

Key Takeaways
• Dogs don't actually "forget" - their brains are rewiring during development

Hi again,
Yesterday you rated your dog's recall. Today I want to tell you about the moment I realized what was really happening with "teenage" dogs.
I was working with my Frenchie, Francesca, when she was about 18 months old. I called her name, and she looked directly at me, made deliberate eye contact... and then turned around and walked away.
Not ran away. Walked. Like she was saying, "I heard you, I just don't feel like it."
That's when it hit me: this wasn't forgetfulness. This was a choice.
Here's What's Really Happening
Your dog didn't actually forget their training. What happened is their brain hit a developmental milestone - the same thing human teenagers experience.
Think about a 16-year-old who knows perfectly well how to clean their room. They've done it hundreds of times. But suddenly when you ask them to clean it, they act like you're speaking ancient Greek.
They didn't forget how to pick up clothes. They're testing boundaries.
Your dog is doing the exact same thing. Their brain is literally asking: "Do I really have to do this? What happens if I don't? What's in it for me?"
The 3 Mistakes That Make It Worse
Here's where most of us (myself included) accidentally train our dogs that ignoring us is optional:
Mistake #1: Turning into a broken record
 "Fido, come! Fido! FIDO, COME! I said COME!"
This is like asking your teenager to clean their room, then asking 47 more times. What you're actually teaching is that the first request is just a suggestion.
Mistake #2: Calling them for things they hate
 Bath time, nail clipping, end of fun at the dog park. It's like if every time someone called your name, something unpleasant happened. You'd start screening your calls too.
Mistake #3: The chase-or-give-up cycle
 When they don't come, we either turn it into a fun game of chase (reward!) or we throw up our hands and walk away (they win!).
Your 48-Hour Communication Reset
Here's what I want you to do - and yes, it's going to feel weird at first:
For the next 48 hours, stop calling your dog entirely.
Think of this like hitting the reset button on a glitchy computer. We're clearing the cache of ignored commands and starting fresh.
Instead:
When you need them, walk over and gently guide them
Give treats randomly when they approach you naturally
Notice when they naturally want to be near you (this is data)
This isn't forever - it's like taking a step back to get a running start at a jump.
During this reset, your dog's brain is going to recalibrate. They'll stop expecting to ignore you, and you'll stop feeling frustrated.
Tomorrow, I'll share the psychology behind why dogs actually want to work for us - and how we accidentally convince them otherwise.

P.S. If you're thinking "But what if there's an emergency?" - that's what leashes are for. We're just removing the word "come" temporarily, not your ability to manage your dog safely. Think of it as putting that word in time-out.

Email 1.3: The Psychology of "Paying Your Dog to Work"
Subject Line: [1.3] Why your dog stopped working for free (and what they want instead)
Pre-header: The "paycheck" psychology that changes everything + the treat station strategy

Key Takeaways
• Dogs learn through "What's in it for me?" not "Because I said so" 
• Your dog isn't being stubborn - they're asking about their paycheck 
• Treat stations around your house create a "reward-rich environment" 
• Random rewards work better than predictable ones
Read Time: 3 minutes

Hi again,
How did your 48-hour reset go? I'm curious what you noticed when you stopped calling your dog and just observed their natural behavior instead.
Today I want to share a story that changed how I think about dog training forever.
I was working with a family whose Border Collie, Max, had become completely unreliable. Smart dog - could solve puzzle toys, knew dozens of commands, clearly understood what they wanted. But when they called him? He'd look at them like they were asking him to work overtime without pay.
Which, it turns out, is exactly what was happening.
The mom said something that stopped me in my tracks: "He used to be so eager to please. Now it's like he's constantly asking 'What's in it for me?'"
And I said, "That's because he IS asking that. And right now, your answer is 'nothing.'"
The Economics of Dog Behavior
Here's what most people don't understand: dogs are natural economists. Every behavior is a cost-benefit analysis, and right now, your dog has decided that listening to you pays worse than a unpaid internship.
Think about your own job. You show up Monday because there's a paycheck Friday. You work harder when your boss is watching than when they're in meetings. Your dog operates the same way - they're just more honest about it.
Your dog's brain works the same way.
When Max was a puppy, everything was new and exciting. Just hearing "Good boy!" felt like winning the lottery. But as he grew up, praise became like background music - nice, but not particularly motivating.
It's like if your boss kept saying "Great job!" but never gave you actual raises, promotions, or time off. Eventually, you'd start looking for a better deal elsewhere.
Your dog isn't being stubborn. They're negotiating.
The "What's In It For Me?" Test
Here's a quick test: think about the last time you called your dog and they ignored you.
Now ask yourself: from THEIR perspective, what was their reward for coming?
Did you immediately clip on their leash to leave the dog park?
Call them in from the backyard where they were having fun?
Ask them to get off the couch they were perfectly comfortable on?
From their point of view, "come" meant "your fun is over."
No wonder they started screening your calls.
The Treat Station Strategy
Here's how we fix this, and it's simpler than you think.
Set up 3 treat stations around your house:
Small container by your desk
One in the kitchen
One by the couch (wherever you spend time)
For the next week: Every time your dog approaches you naturally - not when you call them, just when they wander over - give them a treat.
What you're really doing: Changing their fundamental association with being near you.
Instead of "being close to humans sometimes means the fun stops," you're teaching "being close to humans often means good things happen."
It's like switching from a stingy boss who only notices mistakes to a generous boss who randomly hands out bonuses. Which boss would you rather work for?
Why This Works So Well
Random rewards are more powerful than predictable ones. It's the same psychology that makes slot machines addictive - you never know when the jackpot might hit.
When your dog learns that approaching you might result in something amazing (but not always), they start checking in more often. They become curious about what you might have for them today.
And here's the beautiful part: once they're reliably choosing to be near you, teaching them to come when called becomes a thousand times easier.
Tomorrow, we start Chapter 2 and dive into the actual recall rules. But first, you need this foundation - a dog who thinks being near you is the best place to be.

P.S. Use really good treats for this - not their regular kibble. Think of it as the difference between getting paid in Monopoly money versus real cash. The better the "currency," the faster this works.
