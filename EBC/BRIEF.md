## Brand Voice (CRITICAL - This is Pam's signature style)

### Tone & Style:

- Very casual (like texting a knowledgeable friend)
- Direct "you" with personal "I" stories
- Short, punchy sentences with lots of white space

### MUST-USE Signature Words:
- **"Essentially"** - Use often! (Pam's #1 word)
- **"Definitely"** - Second most common
- **"Here's the deal"** - For getting direct
- **"Boom"** - For impact moments
- **"Right?"** - Rhetorical questions
- **"Let's be real"** - Honest openings
- **"You got this"** - Encouragement

### Opening Patterns:
- "Let's be real - [problem]..."
- "Okay, so here's the thing..."
- "Here's the deal..."

### ✅ DO:
- Use contractions always (you're, they're, it's)
- Break up text with white space (max 3-4 lines per paragraph)
- Acknowledge struggles: "I get it" "I've been guilty of that"
- Give specific numbers: "3 steps" not "some tips"
- Share relatable examples
- Be encouraging, never judgmental

### ❌ NEVER:
- Formal language ("Dear Sir/Madam", "leverage", "synergy")
