Hey there,
Congratulations - you've just completed the foundation work that most dog owners skip entirely.
You understand why your dog's brain works the way it does. You know never to call for unpleasant things. You're setting them up for success with kindergarten-level recalls. And you're building the focus skills that make everything else possible.
In other words, you've built a solid foundation.
Now comes the real test: making it work in real life.
Welcome to Chapter 3: Making It Happen
Here's what I've learned from working with hundreds of families: knowledge without follow-through is just expensive education.
I can teach you every recall rule in the book, but if you don't consistently apply them when it matters - when your dog is chasing a squirrel, playing keep-away in the backyard, or completely ignoring you on a walk - then we're just having nice conversations about dog psychology.
This chapter is where theory meets reality. Where "sometimes works" becomes "works every time."
The Follow-Through Rules
Foundation rules prevent problems. Follow-through rules solve them.
Rule #3: Make It Happen Every Time
 If you call your dog and they don't come, you must calmly help them complete the behavior. No exceptions. No "oh well, maybe next time."
Rule #4: Never Repeat the Command
 Say "come" once. If they don't respond, don't say it again - go help them do it. Repetition teaches them the first command doesn't count.
These rules sound simple, but they require something many of us struggle with: consistency when it's inconvenient.
What You'll Learn in Chapter 3

 Why dogs "play keep away" and how to stop it, the parallel walking technique, and when to use the "ignore and wait" strategy.
The Inconvenient Truth About Consistency
Let me be honest with you: following through every single time is hard.
It means walking across the yard when you're tired to help your dog complete a recall instead of just giving up.
It means staying calm when your dog ignores you in front of other people instead of getting embarrassed and harsh.
It means using your leash as backup instead of hoping they'll "get it" this time.
But here's what happens when you commit to this level of consistency: your dog learns that "come" isn't a suggestion. It's not negotiable. It's not something they can think about and decide whether they feel like doing.
It just... happens. Every time.
The Real-World Challenges Ahead
In Chapter 2, we worked in easy environments with minimal distractions. Now we're graduating to the scenarios that make or break recall training:
You'll learn to handle: The backyard standoff where your dog looks at you and deliberately walks away. The squirrel that appears mid-walk and turns your well-trained dog into a statue. The moment when you realize you've been accidentally teaching your dog that "come" means "think about it for a while."
You'll master: Staying calm when your dog ignores you in front of the neighbors. Using distance and timing to outsmart distractions before they happen. Winning the "chase me" game without actually playing it.
This is where most people's recall training falls apart - not because their dog "forgot," but because humans get inconsistent when it gets uncomfortable.
Your Chapter 3 Commitment
Before we dive into these follow-through rules, I need you to make a commitment:
For the next four emails, you will follow through every single time you use the word "come."
Not most times. Not when it's convenient. Every time.
If that feels overwhelming, then use "come" less often this week. Remember Rule #2 - only call when you're sure they'll come (or when you're prepared to help them complete it).
Better to have 3 successful, followed-through recalls than 10 ignored ones.
Tomorrow, we tackle Rule #3: Make It Happen Every Time. This is the rule that separates dogs who "sometimes listen" from dogs who are genuinely reliable.
Your foundation is solid. Now let's build reliability on top of it.

Hi there,
I need to tell you about Emma and her Labrador, Jake.
Emma did everything right in the beginning. She learned the foundation rules, practiced focus exercises, set Jake up for success with easy recalls. For two weeks, things were going great.
Then life got busy.
One evening, Emma called Jake to come inside from the backyard. He looked at her, then went back to sniffing something fascinating by the fence.
Emma was tired. She had dinner to make, kids to help with homework. So she called again. Then again. Finally, she just went inside and left Jake out there.
"He'll come when he's ready," she told herself.
What Emma didn't realize was that in that moment, she accidentally taught Jake that "come" was a suggestion, not a requirement.
Within a week, Jake's recall went from reliable to optional. Emma couldn't understand what happened. "He was doing so well!"
That's the power of Rule #3: If you call your dog and they don't come, you must make it happen. Every single time.
Why Optional Recalls Are Recall Killers
Your dog's brilliant brain quickly learns: "Sometimes 'come' means I have to stop what I'm doing. But sometimes, if I just look busy enough, they'll give up or come get me anyway."
Why rush over when there's a chance you can finish sniffing that fascinating spot first?
Dogs are pattern-recognition masters. Just a few "optional" recalls teach them your commands are suggestions, not requirements. And undoing that lesson takes way longer than getting it right from the start.
What "Make It Happen" Actually Means
This rule does NOT mean:
Chasing your dog around the yard
Getting angry or frustrated
Physically dragging them to you
Turning it into a confrontation
It DOES mean:
Calmly walking over to help them complete the behavior
Using your leash as gentle guidance
Following through in a way that feels inevitable, not punitive
Making it easier for them to succeed than to resist
The Calm Follow-Through Method
Here's exactly how to follow through when your dog doesn't come:
Step 1: Wait 3-5 seconds
 Give them a moment to process and respond. Some dogs need a beat to shift gears.
Step 2: Walk toward them calmly
 Not fast, not with frustration. Like you're just going for a pleasant stroll in their direction.
Step 3: Get within leash range
 If they have a leash on, pick it up. If not, get close enough to gently guide them.
Step 4: Guide them back to where you called from
 Use gentle leash pressure or your body to help them move toward you. Don't drag - just make it clear this is happening.
Step 5: Reward when they arrive
 Even though you had to help them, still reward when they get to you. You're reinforcing the completion of the behavior, not how they got there.
Your Leash is Your Best Friend
I always tell clients: if you're working on recall, keep a leash on your dog during practice sessions. Not to drag them around, but as insurance.
With a leash, follow-through becomes gentle and non-confrontational. You're not chasing or grabbing - you're just providing clear guidance about what needs to happen next.
Even in your fenced backyard, keep a long line (15-30 feet) attached during training sessions. It transforms follow-through from a wrestling match into calm guidance.
The Backyard Scenario
Let's talk about the most common scenario: your dog in the backyard, clearly hearing you but deciding that stick/smell/bird is more interesting.
Don't: Stand at the door calling repeatedly
 Do: Walk out, pick up their leash or get within guiding distance, and help them come inside
Don't: Make it a chase game
 Do: Use the parallel walking technique - walk alongside them toward the door instead of directly at them
Don't: Get frustrated and give up
 Do: Stay calm and matter-of-fact, like this outcome was always inevitable
When They Try to Make It a Game
Some dogs will try to turn follow-through into play. They'll bow, bounce around, or try to get you to chase them.
Don't take the bait.
Stay calm, boring, and inevitable. If they want to play, that can happen AFTER they complete the recall. Right now, we're just finishing what we started.
This isn't punishment - it's just consistency. Like a parent who calmly but firmly follows through on bedtime, even when the kid tries to negotiate.
Your Practice Assignment This Week
I want you to practice 10 "helped" recalls this week. These are recalls where you call your dog, and if they don't come immediately, you help them complete it.
Start with easy scenarios (indoors, minimal distractions) and work up to harder ones.
Remember:
Say "come" once
Wait 3-5 seconds
If they don't come, go help them
Stay calm throughout
Reward when they arrive (even with help)
The goal isn't to create perfect, independent recalls this week. The goal is to establish that "come" always gets completed, one way or another.
Tomorrow, we'll tackle Rule #4: Never Repeat the Command. This one will save you from accidentally training your dog that the first command doesn't count.
But first, practice being the calm, consistent leader who follows through every time. Your dog is watching to see if you mean what you say.
Show them you do.

Follow through every time,
Pam
 Down 4 Paws Dog Training
P.S. Remember, this isn't about being strict or mean. It's about being trustworthy and predictable. When your dog knows you always follow through, they stop testing and start responding. That's actually more comfortable for them than living in uncertainty about whether you mean what you say.

Subject Line: [3.2] The one-call rule that builds instant respect
Pre-header: Why saying "come" twice teaches your dog the first one doesn't count + breaking the repetition habit

Key Takeaways
• Repeating commands accidentally teaches dogs that the first one is just a warm-up 
• The psychology of repetition undermines your authority and creates hesitation 
• Say "come" once, then go help them complete it - no exceptions 
• Breaking the repetition habit transforms your relationship in days, not weeks

Hey there,
Let me paint you a picture that might feel familiar:
Your teenager is sprawled on the couch, homework undone, dinner getting cold on the table.
"Time for dinner," you call from the kitchen.
Nothing.
"Dinner!" you try again, a little louder.
Still scrolling their phone.
"DINNER! NOW!"
Finally, they drag themselves to the table with an eye roll that could power a small city.
What just happened? You accidentally taught them that the first two dinner calls are just... practice rounds. The real one is when you use your "serious" voice.
This is exactly what we do to our dogs with recall commands.
The Warm-Up Command Problem
Here's the uncomfortable truth: every time you say "come" more than once, you're training your dog that the first command doesn't really count.
Think about it like an auction. "Going once... going twice..." The auctioneer teaches everyone to wait until "sold!" before they need to actually act.
You're accidentally running an auction every time you call your dog:
"Fido, come!" (Going once...)
 "Fido, COME!" (Going twice...)
 "FIDO, GET OVER HERE NOW!" (Sold!)
Your dog learns to wait for the "sold!" version before they need to actually move.
Why Repetition Kills Authority
In any relationship - parent-child, teacher-student, boss-employee - the person who has to repeat themselves loses a little authority each time.
It's not about being mean or harsh. It's about being clear and trustworthy in your communication.
When you say something once and follow through, you become someone worth listening to the first time. When you say it five times before acting, you become background noise until you hit your breaking point.
Dogs are incredibly smart about reading these patterns. They know the difference between your "casual suggestion" voice and your "I really mean it" voice. And they've learned they can safely ignore everything until you switch to the second one.
The Physical Urge to Repeat
I get it - fighting the urge to repeat yourself feels almost impossible at first.
Your dog doesn't come immediately, and your brain screams "Say it again! Louder! They didn't hear you!"
But here's what's really happening: your dog DID hear you. They're just calculating whether this is a "first call" (which they can ignore) or a "final call" (which requires action).
When you don't repeat yourself and instead go help them complete the behavior, you collapse that calculation. There's no more "first call vs. final call" - there's just "the call," followed by inevitable completion.
The One-Call Method
Here's your new protocol, and it's beautifully simple:
Say "come" once - Clear, confident, normal volume
Count to five - Give them a moment to process and respond
If they don't come, go help them - No second command, just follow-through
That's it. No drama, no frustration, no escalation. Just calm, inevitable consistency.
What This Looks Like in Practice
Scenario: Your dog is in the backyard, sniffing something fascinating.
Old way:
 "Bella, come!"
 Nothing
 "Bella! Come here!"
 Still sniffing
 "BELLA! COME HERE RIGHT NOW!"
 Finally looks up
New way:
 "Bella, come!"
 Count to five
 Walk out, pick up leash, guide her inside
 Reward when she gets there
In the first scenario, you taught Bella that she has at least three chances to finish sniffing before she needs to respond.
In the second scenario, you taught her that "come" means "this is happening now."
The Resistance You'll Feel
Your brain is going to fight this new system. It feels "wrong" not to repeat yourself. You'll worry your dog didn't hear you, didn't understand, or is being "defiant."
Remember: your dog's hearing is better than yours. They understood. They're not being defiant - they're just operating under the rules you've accidentally taught them.
This feels uncomfortable because you're changing a deeply ingrained pattern. But stick with it for one week, and you'll be amazed at how quickly your dog starts responding to the first command.
Your One-Call Challenge
For the next week, I want you to use the "one call rule" for everything - not just recall.
"Sit" - say it once, then gently help them into position if needed.
 "Down" - say it once, then guide them down if necessary.
 "Come" - say it once, then follow through with calm guidance.
This isn't about being stern or intimidating. It's about being clear, consistent, and trustworthy in your communication.
Tomorrow, we'll dive into the distraction protocol - how to be proactive (not reactive) when your dog is tempted by squirrels, other dogs, and all the interesting things in their world.
But first, practice being someone worth listening to the first time. Your dog is waiting to see if you mean what you say.

One call, then follow through,
Pam
 Down 4 Paws Dog Training
P.S. The most common question I get about this rule is "But what if my dog really didn't hear me?" Here's the thing: if they truly didn't hear you, going over to help them complete the behavior accomplishes the same thing as repeating yourself, but without accidentally training them to wait for multiple commands. Trust me on this one.

Key Takeaways
• Distractions aren't training failures - they're opportunities to practice real-world skills 
• Being proactive beats being reactive every single time 
• Distance is your friend: the closer the distraction, the harder the recall 
• High-value treats and strategic positioning prevent most distraction problems

Hi there,
Picture this: You're walking through the park with your dog, feeling pretty good about their recent progress. You've been practicing the foundation rules, following through consistently, and things are clicking.
Then it happens.
A squirrel darts across the path 20 feet ahead. Your dog's head snaps up, body goes rigid, and suddenly it's like you've disappeared from the planet. You call their name - nothing. You might as well be speaking ancient Greek.
Welcome to distraction training, where your living room successes meet the real world.
The Squirrel is Not the Enemy
Here's the first thing to understand: distractions aren't problems to solve - they're opportunities to practice what really matters.
Think of distractions like pop quizzes in school. They don't exist to make your life difficult. They exist to show you what you actually know versus what you think you know.
A dog who comes when called in your quiet kitchen but ignores you completely around squirrels hasn't actually learned recall yet. They've learned "kitchen recall" - which is like knowing how to swim in a kiddie pool but panicking in the ocean.
Reactive vs. Proactive: The Game Changer
Most people handle distractions reactively. They wait for their dog to see the squirrel, get fixated, and THEN try to call them away.
This is like trying to have a conversation with someone at a rock concert. The distraction is already louder than you are.
Reactive approach: Dog sees squirrel → Dog gets fixated → You try to compete with the squirrel → You lose
Proactive approach: You see potential distraction → You get your dog's attention BEFORE they fixate → You become more interesting than the distraction → You win
The difference? Timing and awareness.
Distance is Your Secret Weapon
Here's what I've learned from hundreds of distraction scenarios: the closer your dog is to something interesting, the harder it becomes to get their attention.
It's like asking someone to leave a party. If they're standing in the doorway, still hearing the music, it's much harder than if they're already halfway down the block.
The Distance Rule:
50+ feet from distraction: Normal recall should work
20-50 feet: Use high-value treats and get their attention first
Under 20 feet: Don't even try to recall - create distance first
Instead of fighting proximity, use it strategically.
The Proactive Distraction Protocol
Here's your step-by-step system for handling distractions before they handle you:
Step 1: Scan ahead
 Always be aware of what's coming. Other dogs, people, wildlife, interesting smells. You're the early warning system.
Step 2: Assess the threat level
 Is this something your dog will find mildly interesting or completely captivating? Adjust your strategy accordingly.
Step 3: Get attention BEFORE fixation
 Call your dog's name or make an interesting noise while they can still think clearly. Once they're in "hunting mode," you've missed your window.
Step 4: Create positive distance
 Don't run away from the distraction - that creates excitement. Instead, walk confidently in a different direction, making yourself interesting to follow.
Step 5: Reward heavily for choosing you
 When your dog follows you instead of investigating the distraction, make it rain treats. They just made the hardest choice in the dog world.
High-Value Treats: Your Ace in the Hole
Around distractions, your usual training treats are like bringing a water pistol to a firefight. You need the good stuff.
Think cheese sticks, small pieces of chicken, hot dog bits - whatever makes your dog forget their own name (in a good way).
But here's the key: don't wait until they're already fixated to bring out the premium treats. Use them proactively, when you see the distraction coming but before your dog has noticed it.
Common Distraction Scenarios (And How to Handle Them)
The Backyard Squirrel
 Don't call your dog away from the squirrel. Instead, get their attention before they fully lock onto it, then make being near you more rewarding than squirrel-watching.
The Other Dog on the Walk
 See the approaching dog from a distance. Get your dog focused on you with treats and praise before they have a chance to get overly excited about their potential new friend.
The Fascinating Smell
 If your dog is deep into investigation mode, don't compete with the smell. Wait for them to naturally lift their head, then immediately reward that attention shift.
The Ice Machine/Sudden Noise
 Environmental surprises are great training opportunities. When your dog chooses to look at you instead of investigating the noise, jackpot that choice.
When NOT to Recall Around Distractions
Sometimes the smartest move is not to play the game at all.
Don't call if:
Your dog is in full "hunting mode" (body rigid, intense focus)
You're too close to the distraction to compete
You don't have high-value rewards available
You're not prepared to follow through if they ignore you
Instead, create distance, wait for a better moment, or simply manage the situation without using recall commands.
Your Distraction Practice Challenge
This week, I want you to practice the proactive approach:
Identify your dog's top 3 distractions during your regular walks
Practice the protocol with lower-level distractions first (mildly interesting vs. completely captivating)
Bring high-value treats on every walk - be prepared to reward heavily
Create distance when you need it - there's no shame in strategic retreat
Remember: every successful proactive intervention builds your dog's trust that following you is always the right choice, even when the world is full of interesting alternatives.
Tomorrow, we'll tackle the backyard recall game - why dogs love to play "keep away" and how to win that game once and for all.

P.S. The goal isn't to make your dog ignore all distractions forever. The goal is to teach them that checking in with you first - even when something interesting is happening - always pays off. That's how you build a dog who chooses you even when they don't have to.

Key Takeaways
• "Keep away" is your dog's favorite game - and you've been accidentally playing it 
• Chasing your dog teaches them that not coming is more fun than coming 
• The parallel walking technique makes you interesting to follow instead of fun to avoid

Hi there,
Let me set a scene that plays out in backyards across the country every single day:
It's time to come inside. You open the door and call your dog. They look at you from across the yard, and you can practically see the wheels turning in their head.
"Hmm," they seem to think, "I could go inside like a good dog... OR I could turn this into the most fun game ever invented."
They choose the game.
You step into the yard. They take a few steps away, tail wagging, play bow at the ready. You move toward them, they dance just out of reach. You try to corner them, they dart around you like a furry little soccer player.
Fifteen minutes later, you're sweaty, frustrated, and your dog is having the time of their life.
Congratulations. You just got played.
The Accidental Game We Teach
Your dog isn't being "bad" when they play keep away. They're being brilliant.
From their perspective: "Coming inside = fun over. But if I run away, human chases me = MORE fun!"
It's like a kid discovering that running from mom at the playground turns leaving into a new game.
We accidentally teach this by taking the bait. The moment we chase, we've entered their game on their terms. And they're much better at it than we are.
Why Chasing Never Works
Chasing a dog who doesn't want to come is like trying to catch a greased pig at a county fair. The harder you try, the more ridiculous you look, and the pig is having a blast.
But there's a deeper problem: every time you chase your dog, you're teaching them that not coming when called leads to the most exciting activity possible - a high-speed pursuit game with their favorite human.
You're literally rewarding them for ignoring you.
No wonder they keep doing it.
The Parallel Walking Technique
Here's the game-changer that stops the chase before it starts:
Instead of walking directly toward your dog (which triggers their "chase me!" instincts), walk parallel to them - like you're both headed to the same interesting destination.
Think of it like this: You're not a predator stalking prey. You're a fellow explorer on an adventure, and they're welcome to join you.
Here's how it works:
Step into the yard calmly - no urgency, no direct eye contact
Walk alongside your dog's position - parallel, not toward them
Act like you're going somewhere interesting - purposeful movement, maybe humming or talking to yourself
When they get curious and move toward you - THEN you can gently guide them inside
Dogs are naturally curious and social. When you stop focusing on them and start acting like you're on an important mission, they often think, "Wait, where are we going?" and follow.
The Psychology Behind It
This technique works because it transforms the entire dynamic:
Chase scenario: You want something from them (compliance) → They have the power → Game on!
Parallel walk scenario: You're going somewhere interesting → They want something from you (inclusion) → You have the power
It's the difference between being a demanding boss and being the cool kid everyone wants to hang out with.
When to Use the "Ignore and Wait" Strategy
Sometimes the smartest move is not to play any game at all.
If your dog is clearly in "game mode" - bouncing around, play bowing, that mischievous look in their eyes - don't engage.
Go back inside. Close the door. Wait.
Most dogs will be at the door within 2-3 minutes, wondering where their playmate went.
This isn't punishment - it's just removing yourself from a game you don't want to play. Like a parent who stops reacting to their toddler's tantrum, you're teaching your dog that certain behaviors simply don't work.
The "Interesting Human" Approach
Want to become irresistible to follow? Start doing interesting things in the yard instead of focusing on your dog.
Try this:
Walk around examining plants like you're a botanist
Pick up sticks and move them to different locations
Talk to yourself about fascinating yard discoveries
Act like you're on a treasure hunt
Dogs hate missing out on interesting activities. Your "boring" human suddenly becomes the most fascinating thing in the yard.
Your Backyard Practice Challenge
This week, practice these three scenarios:
Scenario 1: The Parallel Walk
 Next time your dog doesn't come when called, try the parallel walking technique. Walk confidently alongside them toward the door, acting like you're on a mission.
Scenario 2: The Ignore Strategy
 If they're clearly in game mode, go back inside and wait. Time how long it takes them to appear at the door (most people are surprised how quickly this works).
Scenario 3: The Interesting Human
 Spend 5 minutes in the yard doing "fascinating" activities while ignoring your dog. Watch how quickly they come to investigate what you're up to.
Breaking the Pattern
Remember: if your dog has been successfully playing the chase game for months or years, it might take a few sessions for them to realize the rules have changed.
Be patient. Stay consistent. Don't take the bait when they try to initiate the old game.
You're not being mean by refusing to chase them. You're being smart by refusing to reinforce behavior that makes recall harder.
Tomorrow, we start Chapter 4, where we'll dive into Rule #5 (fabulous rewards) and advanced scenarios that put everything together.

P.S. The most common mistake people make with the parallel walking technique is moving too fast or looking too obviously like they're trying to "trick" their dog. Dogs are smart - they can spot fake interesting behavior from a mile away. Commit to the act. Be genuinely curious about that stick or fascinating patch of grass. Your dog will buy into whatever energy you're putting out.
