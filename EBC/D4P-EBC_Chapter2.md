Hi there,
You just completed Chapter 1, which means you understand what's happening in your dog's teenage brain. You've stopped taking their "selective hearing" personally and started seeing it as normal development.
Now we're ready to build something solid.
Welcome to Chapter 2: Building the Foundation
Think about the last time you watched someone build a house. What's the most boring part? The foundation. Nobody gets excited about concrete and rebar.
But here's what I've learned in over a decade of training: the families who skip foundation work are the ones calling me six months later, frustrated that "nothing works."
The families who nail the foundation? Their dogs become the ones other people ask about. "How did you get such good recall?"
What You'll Learn in Chapter 2
Email 2.1: Rule #1 - Never Call for Unpleasant Things
 The psychology behind why this matters, common mistakes that sabotage recall, and how to change your habits starting today.
Email 2.2: Rule #2 - Only Call When Sure They'll Come
 How to set your dog up for success, the "kindergarten vs graduate level" concept, and building confidence through wins.
Email 2.3: Focus & Attention Exercises
 The foundation skill that comes before recall - if your dog won't focus on you, they can't come when called. Plus the airplane game for jumping dogs.
Why Foundation Comes First
Right now, your dog might come when called... sometimes. When they feel like it. When nothing interesting is happening.
That's not reliable recall - that's gambling.
These two foundation rules eliminate the guesswork. They stop you from accidentally teaching your dog that "come" is optional. They build the psychology that makes your dog WANT to listen.
Advanced techniques are flashy. Foundation work is boring. But I'd rather have a dog with rock-solid basics than one who knows fifty tricks but won't come when it matters.
Your Chapter 2 Mission
For the next three emails, I want you to become a student of your own habits.
Notice:
When do you currently call your dog?
What usually happens right after they come to you?
How many times do you repeat commands?
What's your dog's body language when you call them?
Don't try to fix anything yet - just observe. We're gathering intelligence on both you and your dog.
The first rule arrives tomorrow, and it's going to make you rethink every time you've called your dog's name.

Hi again,
Let me tell you about the moment I learned this rule the hard way.
I had been working with my Frenchie, Francesca, for weeks on recall. She was doing great - coming when called, getting treats, both of us feeling pretty proud of our progress.
Then one evening, I needed to give her a bath. She was muddy, I was tired, and I took a shortcut.
"Francesca, come!" I called from the bathroom.
She trotted over happily, tail wagging, expecting her usual treat. Instead, I scooped her up and plopped her in the tub.
The look of betrayal in her eyes will haunt me forever.
For the next two weeks, every time I called her name, she'd pause. Look at me suspiciously. Like she was thinking, "Is this a treat situation... or a bath situation?"
That's when I learned Rule #1 the hard way: Never call your dog for anything unpleasant. Not even once.
Why This Rule Matters More Than You Think
Dogs are natural economists. Every interaction with you is a cost-benefit analysis, and they have incredibly long memories for experiences that didn't go their way.
Think about it from their perspective: if every time your boss called you into their office, something unpleasant happened (criticism, extra work, bad news), how would you start feeling when you heard your name?
You'd start screening those calls.
That's exactly what happens with dogs. One "come" that leads to nail clipping, and suddenly your dog starts calculating whether it's worth the risk.
The Sneaky Ways We Break This Rule
Most people think they don't do this. "I never call my dog for punishment," they tell me.
But here are the ways this rule gets broken that you might not realize:
The End-of-Fun Call
 Calling them to leave the dog park, come inside from the backyard, or stop playing with other dogs. From their perspective, "come" means "your fun is over."
The Necessary Evil Call
 Bath time, vet visits, nail trims, getting in the car for somewhere they don't want to go. You think "they have to learn," but what they learn is "don't trust that word."
The Convenience Call
 Calling them to move off the couch, get out of your way, or stop doing something perfectly normal (like sniffing) because you're in a hurry.
The Worried Parent Call
 "Come here, let me see that cut on your paw" or "Come, I need to check your teeth." Your concern reads as "vet visit" to them.
What Your Dog Thinks is "Unpleasant"
This is where it gets tricky. What you consider normal, your dog might consider unpleasant:
Getting their harness put on (if they don't like the process)
Being moved from their favorite sleeping spot
Having their food/toys taken away
Being interrupted during something interesting
Physical handling they're not used to
Going somewhere new that makes them nervous
The rule isn't about what you think is unpleasant - it's about what your dog experiences as unpleasant.
The Alternative: Go Get Them Instead
"But Pam," you're thinking, "how am I supposed to get my dog for necessary things?"
Simple: you walk over and get them.
When Francesca needs a bath now, I don't call her. I walk to wherever she is, give her a treat, and then calmly guide her to the bathroom.
Sometimes I'll even give her a few treats in the tub before we start. The message becomes: "Even when we have to do something you don't love, good things still happen."
This takes 30 seconds longer than calling her. But it preserves weeks of recall training.
Your Assignment This Week
I want you to make two lists:
List 1: Times you currently call your dog
 Write down every situation where you use their name or "come" over the next two days. Just observe and record.
List 2: Pleasant vs. Unpleasant
 Go through your List 1 and honestly assess: from your dog's perspective, what usually happens after they come to you in each situation?
Mark each one:
😊 Pleasant (treats, praise, play, attention)
😐 Neutral (nothing special happens)
😞 Unpleasant (fun ends, they get moved, something they don't like happens)
Tomorrow, we'll tackle Rule #2, which is all about setting your dog up to win. But first, let's eliminate the recalls that accidentally teach your dog to avoid you.
Your dog isn't being stubborn when they don't come. They're being smart. Let's make sure coming to you is always the smart choice.

Start observing those calls,

P.S. If you realize you've been breaking this rule (we all have!), don't panic. Dogs are forgiving. Just start making new, positive associations with "come" from today forward. The good news is they remember positive experiences just as well as negative ones.


Email 2.2: Deep Dive - Rule #2 (Only Call When Sure They'll Come)
Subject Line: [2.2] Stop making recall "optional" for your dog
Pre-header: The kindergarten vs. graduate school mistake + how to stack wins starting today

Key Takeaways
• Only call your dog when you're confident they'll actually come 
• Every ignored "come" makes the next one weaker 
• Start with "kindergarten level" recalls and build up slowly 
• If you're not sure they'll come, don't call - go get them instead

Hey there,
Yesterday I got a text from a client: "Pam, I'm standing in my backyard calling Duke for 10 minutes. He's just staring at me from across the yard like I'm speaking another language. What do I do?"
My response? "Stop calling him and go get him."
"But shouldn't he learn to come when called?"
Here's what I told her: Every time you call your dog and they don't come, you're accidentally teaching them that "come" is a suggestion, not a command.
That's Rule #2: Only call when you're pretty sure they'll come.
The "Optional Recall" Problem
Think about this scenario: You call your dog's name. They look at you, assess their options (you vs. that interesting smell), and decide the smell wins. You call again. They glance over, then go back to sniffing.
What just happened? You taught them that the first "come" doesn't really count. Maybe not even the second one.
Now multiply that by dozens of interactions over weeks and months. Your dog learns that "come" really means "think about it, and if you feel like it, maybe wander over eventually."
This is why some dogs develop what I call "selective hearing." They're not being stubborn - they're being rational. You've accidentally taught them that your recall command is optional.
The Kindergarten vs. Graduate School Mistake
Here's where most people go wrong: they expect graduate-level performance from kindergarten-level students.
Graduate Level: Calling your dog away from a squirrel, another dog, or their favorite sniffing spot
 Kindergarten Level: Calling your dog when they're already looking at you or walking toward you
Most people skip kindergarten and jump straight to the hard stuff. Then they wonder why their dog "won't listen."
It's like asking a kid who just learned to read to tackle Shakespeare. They're not ready yet, and pushing too hard just frustrates everyone.
How to Assess Before You Call
Before you say "come," ask yourself:
What's competing for their attention right now?
Other dogs, people, or animals
Interesting smells or sounds
Food on the ground
Something they're actively engaged in
What's their body language telling you?
Are they already facing you?
Do they look relaxed or hyper-focused on something else?
Are they in "hunting mode" (head down, tail stiff, intense focus)?
What's your success rate been today?
If they've ignored you twice already, don't try a third time
If they're having an "off day," make it easier
When NOT to Call (Go Get Them Instead)
Based on what I've learned from hundreds of families, here are the times you should walk over instead of calling:
The Backyard Standoff
 Your dog is across the yard, clearly sees you, but has decided that patch of grass is more interesting than you are.
The Distraction Situation
 Anything involving squirrels, other dogs, interesting smells, or that perfect stick they found.
The "Zoomies" Moment
 When they're in full-on play mode, running around like they've been shot out of a cannon.
The Selective Hearing Day
 Some days, dogs just aren't feeling it. Honor that and make it easier on both of you.
The Parallel Walking Technique
Here's my secret weapon for the backyard standoff: don't walk directly toward your dog. Instead, walk parallel to them, like you're going somewhere interesting.
Dogs are naturally curious. When you stop focusing on them and act like you're on an important mission, they often think, "Wait, where are we going?" and follow.
Once they start moving toward you, THEN you can call them and reward them for coming. You've just created a success instead of a failure.
Your Kindergarten-Level Practice Assignment
This week, I want you to practice 5 "easy win" recalls indoors:
The Already-Coming Recall: Call them when they're already walking toward you
The Mealtime Recall: Call them when it's dinner time (they're already motivated)
The Bored Dog Recall: Call them when they're just lying around with nothing to do
The Eye Contact Recall: Call them when they're already looking at you
The Short Distance Recall: Call them from just a few feet away in a quiet room
Make each one a party. Treats, praise, the whole celebration. Let them experience that "come" always leads to good things.
These might feel too easy, but here's what you're really doing: you're building their confidence that they CAN do this, and your confidence that you CAN get reliable results.
Tomorrow, we'll dive into the foundation skill that comes before recall - if your dog won't focus on you, they can't come when called. Plus, I'll show you my favorite game for dogs who like to jump all over you.
But first, stack some wins. Build that trust. Make "come" feel like the easiest, best decision your dog makes all day.

Go get those easy wins,

P.S. If you're thinking "But my dog should come even when distracted," you're absolutely right. They should. But we're not there yet. Master kindergarten first, and graduate school will be so much easier.

Hi there,
Let me ask you something: when was the last time your dog truly focused on you?
Not glanced in your direction while sniffing something. Not looked at you because you had food. I mean really focused - like you were the most interesting thing in their world.
If you're struggling to remember, you're not alone. And here's why this matters: if your dog won't focus on you, they can't come when called.
Think about it. Recall isn't just about movement - it's about attention. Your dog has to notice you called, decide you're worth paying attention to, and then choose to come over.
Without that first step - attention - everything else falls apart.
The Missing Foundation Skill
Most people jump straight to teaching "come" without teaching "look." It's like trying to have a conversation with someone who won't make eye contact.
I learned this the hard way when I was working with a Golden Retriever named Max. Smart dog, knew dozens of commands, but his recall was terrible. His owner was frustrated: "He knows what 'come' means! He's just being stubborn!"
But when I watched Max, I realized the problem wasn't defiance - it was attention. This dog was so focused on everything else (smells, sounds, movement) that he literally wasn't processing his owner's voice.
We spent two weeks just working on focus. No recall training at all. Just teaching Max that looking at his human made good things happen.
By week three, his recall was better than dogs who'd been "working on it" for months.
Why Focus Exercises Work
When you teach your dog to focus on you, you're really teaching them two things:
Attention pays off - Good things happen when they look at you
You're worth interrupting for - Even when something else is interesting, checking in with you is worthwhile
These exercises create what I call "voluntary attention" - your dog chooses to focus on you because they've learned it's rewarding, not because you're forcing them to.
Exercise 1: The Basic Leave It Focus Game
Start with a treat in your closed fist. Hold it near your dog's nose level.
Your dog will probably sniff, lick, and paw at your hand. Don't say anything. Just wait.
The moment - and I mean the split second - they stop trying to get the treat and look at your face instead, mark it ("Yes!" or click) and give them the treat.
What you're teaching: "When I stop focusing on what I want and focus on my human instead, good things happen."
Repeat this 5-10 times. Most dogs catch on quickly that the "game" is to look at you, not fight for the treat.
Exercise 2: The Airplane Game (For Jumping Dogs)
If your dog jumps on you (especially when you have treats), this game is gold.
Hold a treat in your hand above your dog's head - high enough they can't reach it by jumping.
If they jump, the treat goes higher (like an airplane taking off). If all four paws are on the ground, the treat slowly comes down (like an airplane landing).
The rule: The treat only "lands" when they're calm and grounded.
What usually happens: Your dog will jump a few times, realize it's not working, then stand and look at you like "What's the game here?"
That's the moment you reward - when they stop the jumping behavior and focus on you instead.
Exercise 3: The Distraction Focus Challenge
This one's more advanced, but incredibly powerful.
Place a treat on the floor, but don't let your dog get it yet. You can step on it, cover it with your foot, or use a long leash to prevent access.
Now wait. Your dog will probably stare at the treat, try to get around you, maybe whine or paw.
But eventually, they'll look up at you with an expression that says "A little help here?"
The moment they make eye contact, mark it and let them have the treat.
What you're teaching: "When I'm frustrated or want something, the answer comes from checking in with my human."
The 5-Minute Daily Focus Session
Here's how to build this into your routine:
Morning (2 minutes): Basic leave it focus game while you're getting ready
 Afternoon (1 minute): Quick focus check-ins when they approach you naturally
 Evening (2 minutes): Airplane game or distraction challenge while you're watching TV
That's it. Five minutes total. But those five minutes will transform how your dog relates to you.
What You'll Notice This Week
As you practice these exercises, watch for these changes:
Your dog starts making more eye contact throughout the day
They check in with you more often during walks
When something interesting happens, they look at you first instead of bolting toward it
They seem more "tuned in" to you in general
These might seem like small changes, but they're huge. You're building the foundation for not just better recall, but better communication overall.
Tomorrow, we start Chapter 3, where we'll put these foundation skills to work with the follow-through rules that make recall non-negotiable.
But first, spend this week teaching your dog that you're worth paying attention to. Everything else builds from here.

P.S. If your dog is already good at these focus exercises, don't skip them. Even "easy" dogs benefit from daily attention work. Think of it as relationship maintenance - a few minutes a day keeps your connection strong.
